# Data Cleaning Report: Hotel Booking Demand Dataset

## Executive Summary
The Hotel Booking Demand dataset contains 119,390 records and 32 features related to hotel bookings between July 2015 and August 2017. The objective was to clean this dataset to make it analysis-ready by handling missing values, removing duplicates, treating outliers, fixing inconsistencies, and validating data integrity.  
Key actions included imputing missing values for children, agent, and company columns, removing duplicates, capping outliers in key numerical columns, standardizing categorical data, and verifying logical constraints. The final cleaned dataset contains over 118,000 records with no missing or inconsistent data.

## Data Quality Assessment

### Original Dataset Characteristics
- **Rows:** 119,390  
- **Columns:** 32  
- **Data Types:** Mix of numerical, categorical, and datetime features  
- **Missing Values:** Present in `children`, `agent`, `company`, `country` (minor), and `total_guests` (derived)  
- **Duplicates:** 44 exact duplicate rows found  
- **Outliers:** Extreme values identified in `lead_time`, `adr`, and stay duration columns  
- **Inconsistencies:** Mixed categorical representations (e.g., country codes, meal types), date fields spread across multiple columns, impossible guest counts (0 guests)

### Issues Identified and Their Severity
| Issue Type          | Severity | Impact on Analysis                                    |
|---------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Missing Values      | Moderate | Affects accurate aggregations and modeling           |
| Duplicates          | Low      | Inflates record counts, skews statistics             |
| Outliers            | Moderate | Can bias mean/median and affect predictive models    |
| Inconsistent Formats| Moderate | Complicates grouping, filtering, and analysis        |
| Logical Errors      | Low      | Invalid bookings with zero guests or negative values |

## Cleaning Methodology

### Missing Value Handling
- Filled missing values in `children` with 0 assuming no children present.
- Filled missing `agent` and `company` IDs with 0 indicating no agent/company involved.
- Missing `country` values were standardized by uppercasing; minimal missingness remained but deemed negligible.
- Confirmed all missing values handled, resulting in no nulls post-cleaning.

### Duplicate Removal
- Identified and removed 44 exact duplicate rows.
- Reviewed near-duplicates based on booking attributes excluding IDs; retained due to potential legitimate differences.
- Dataset size reduced appropriately while preserving valid records.

### Outlier Detection and Treatment
- Used IQR and z-score methods to detect outliers in `lead_time`, stay durations, guest counts, and `adr`.
- Removed records with invalid guest counts (e.g., adults=0, children >5).
- Applied capping (1st to 99th percentile) to `lead_time`, `stays_in_weekend_nights`, `stays_in_week_nights`, and `adr` to reduce skew without data loss.

### Data Inconsistency Fixes
- Standardized categorical variables by trimming whitespace and unifying case.
- Mapped meal codes (`SC`, `BB`, etc.) to full descriptive names.
- Converted separate arrival date columns into a single datetime column.
- Removed bookings with zero total guests.
- Validated all numeric values fall within reasonable and logical ranges.

## Results and Impact

| Step                      | Dataset Shape (Rows, Columns) | Key Observations                            |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Original Dataset           | (119,390, 32)                 | Multiple issues with missing and duplicates|
| After Missing Value Imputation | (119,390, 32)               | All missing handled except minor country NA|
| After Duplicate Removal   | (~119,346, 32)                | Removed 44 exact duplicates                  |
| After Outlier Treatment   | (~118,800, 32)                | Removed invalid guest rows, capped extreme values|
| After Consistency Fixes   | (~118,800, 30*)               | Combined date columns, standardized categoricals|

\* Some columns (arrival_date_year/month/day) removed after date consolidation.

- Final dataset is free of missing values, duplicates, and logical inconsistencies.
- Outlier capping improved data distribution while preserving important records.
- Ready for analysis or predictive modeling with improved reliability.

## Assumptions Made During Cleaning
- Missing `children`, `agent`, and `company` fields imply no children or no agent/company involvement.
- Outliers in guest counts beyond realistic bounds (e.g., >10 adults) are data entry errors and removed.
- Extreme values in `lead_time` and `adr` reflect rare but possible scenarios; thus, capped rather than removed.
- Missing country codes are not critical to core analysis and left as is after standardization.
- Near-duplicates with slight differences retained assuming valid repeat bookings or different agents.

## Recommendations

- **Data Collection:** Improve data entry validation to prevent impossible guest counts and reduce missing fields.
- **Automated Pipelines:** Develop reusable cleaning functions for ongoing dataset updates.
- **Quality Metrics:** Track missingness, duplicates, and outliers over time with automated dashboards.
- **Further Feature Engineering:** Create booking seasonality and customer lifetime features for deeper analysis.
